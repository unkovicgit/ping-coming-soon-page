## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- New CSS Reset

### What I learned

I started using new CSS reset from [Elad Shechter](https://elad2412.github.io/the-new-css-reset/). I learned about it from reading [this CSS tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/an-interview-with-elad-shechter-on-the-new-css-reset). This CSS reset is built from the understanding we don’t want to use the default style we are getting from the browsers, except the ‘display’ property.
